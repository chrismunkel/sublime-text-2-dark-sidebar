Sublime Text 2 - dark sidebar
===========================

How to use the dark sidebar (mac):

1. Navigate to:

    	Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Theme - Default

	*(on windows you just have to find the folder called "Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Theme - Default" the rest is the same)*


2. Find the file called:

		Default.sublime-theme


3. Rename the file to

		Default.sublime-theme_backup

	*(if things go wrong you can just rename the file back to Default.sublime-theme and no harm is done)*

4. Paste the new "Default.sublime-theme" file into the folder to replace the old file

	Enjoy your new sidebar colors!

	If you want different colors for your sidebar, simply open the new "Default.sublime-theme" file in a text editor and edit the colors. Comments in the code explains where you need to change the colors.
